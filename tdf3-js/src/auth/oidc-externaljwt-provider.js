 * OIDC External JWT Provider for browser contexts.
 *
 * Both browser and non-browser flows use OIDC, but the supported OIDC auth mechanisms differ between
 * public (e.g. browser) clients, and confidential (e.g. Node) clients.
 *
 * This provider supports External JWT token exchange auth. This flow assumes that the client has previously authenticated
 * with an external 3rd-party IdP that oidcOrigin has been configured to trust.
 *
 * The client can supply this provider with a JWT issued by that trusted 3rd-party IdP, and that JWT will be exchanged
 * for a tokenset with TDF claims.
 *
 * The client's public key must be set in all OIDC token requests in order to recieve a token with valid
 * Virtru claims. The public key may be passed to this provider's constructor, or supplied post-construction by calling
 * @see setClientPubkey
 * which will force an explicit token refresh
 *
 * Does not inherit from the "base class provider" like other providers because a circular dep
 * isn't worth abstracting a 2-line function in a language with no typechecking, come on people.
