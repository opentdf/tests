## [Unreleased]: https://github.com/opentdf/backend/compare/master...HEAD

## Added

- PLAT-1030: ([#314](https://github.com/virtru/etheria/pull/314)): _minor_
  - For KAS, setting the EO_BLOCK_LIST or EO_ALLOW_LIST env vars now allows
    immediate 403s for uninterested parties based on user_id (email or DN, 
    usually)
  - To block a specific user, set the value to a comma-separated (no whitespace)
    list, e.g. `export EO_BLOCK_LIST=bob@a.com,alice@b.org`.
  - To allow just one user, set `EO_ALLOW_LIST=me@virtru.com`, for example
  - Blocks are tested before allow list, so don't use * on the block list if
    you are also using an allow list. Instead, the presence of a nonempty
    EO_ALLOW_LIST implies that all non-matching userids are disallowed.
