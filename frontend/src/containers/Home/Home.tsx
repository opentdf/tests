      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <p>
        TDF protocol supports ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control). This allows
        TDF protocol to implement policy driven and highly scalable access
        control mechanism.
      </p>

      <h2>Entities</h2>
      <p>
        Entities can consist of non-person entities representing a process or
        server, or person entities representing a user. Entities can be assigned
        multiple Attributes to implement fine grained access permissions to TDF
        files.
      </p>
